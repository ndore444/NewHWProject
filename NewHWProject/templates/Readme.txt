*  Circumstances of programs
*******************************************************

   The program runs successfully outside ouray.cudenver.edu.  
   
   The program was developed in Visual Studios and tested on gnu g++ 4.4.2.  It was 
   compiled, and tested on gcc ouray.cudenver.edu. For me personally for some reason 
   it won't let me run the excutable. The error shown is permission denied. How I 
   could be denied access to my own exec I don't understand. Attempts to google
   this problem returned unfruitful.
